## How to share a Qlty configuration (Part 2)

This repo works in concert with [q-base](https://github.com/rsl/q-base) to provide simple documentation about how to use shared configuration for Rubocop in Qlty.

This repo contains the shared configuration for Qlty in the `linters/shared/plugin.toml` file, as per the [Qlty docs for setting up custom sources](https://docs.qlty.sh/cli/concepts/sources#custom-sources).

The shared Rubocop configuration itself (`.rubocop.yml`) is just at the base of the repo.
